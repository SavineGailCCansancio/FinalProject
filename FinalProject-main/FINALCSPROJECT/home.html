      Introduction:
    </h2> 

  <article class="intro">
    <p>Expectations regarding gender start from birth—beginning with the child’s parents. How the adults treat little boys differently from little girls, how they describe boys as teasing and strong while they describe the latter as gentle and emotional, are small things that can stick to a child’s mentality, and these beliefs, albeit minor, often grow over time through adolescence and adulthood.</p>

    <p>These “little things” can quickly be far-reaching and harmful—affecting societies, professional settings, or casual interactions in general.</p>
    
    <p>It starts with workplace inequality, with those not favorable experiencing wage gaps and/or limited opportunities for promotion or advancement, maybe even exclusion from leadership roles. Then it might lead to educational barriers, with girls being robbed of the opportunity of proper education and a bright future. Sometimes it can even affect medical settings, with inequality leading to limited access to healthcare and more.</p>

    <p>Now there comes the normalization of gender-based violence. Domestic violence must be very, very familiar to you, right? It is for most people—you hear it on news, or maybe even from one of your good friends. Gender inequality often fosters an imbalance of power between the two genders, leading to higher rates of domestic violence, sexual harassment, and assault.</p>

    <p>Well, in general, the normalization of gender inequality, as well as toxic masculinity just prompts and reinforces violence, and abuse as “normal” behaviors. This can prompt cycles of violence within many generations.</p>

    <p>Through articles, stories, and research, we aim to educate people on the damaging effects of gender roles and stereotypes. This will, in addition to the previous points, will also serve as a safe space for powerful stories, giving a voice to those who were initially silenced by the majority. With this, join us as we break the binary; join us to make a difference.</p>
