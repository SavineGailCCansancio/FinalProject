  <p>Our mission is to reshape the narrative around gender by prompting equal opportunities for all people, as well as challenging stereotypes and creating awareness. With this, we can provide a space where everyone can learn, engage, and even contribute to the ongoing discussion of gender equality.</p>
<p>From personal, thought-provoking stories, to tear-jerking interviews, we explore how gender stereotypes and roles influence different areas of people’s lives; from the moment we enter crying, to the moment we leave dying. We address the unspoken and buried stories of how they struggled, as well as how far they’ve come. Our goal is to inspire change and to encourage those with voices to speak up and to create more safe spaces, policies, and communities.</p>
<p>We are more than just a website; we are a step towards a world where people will finally have the courage to refuse to be puppets, controlled by gender stereotypes and driven toward discrimination. Whether or not you have a side on this particular topic, Breaking the Binary will guide you and will be a space for you to learn and grow, as well as to connect with others who also yearn for a more understanding future.</p>
<p>With this, we can work together to break down the binary and rebuild the world where everyone can embrace who they are—regardless of gender.</p>
